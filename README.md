# Titanic-Lifetime-Value-Prediction-Customer-Analytics-ML-Modeling
ðŸ“Š Titanic Lifetime Value Prediction â€“ ML &amp; Analytics  A machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using **XGBoost** Regression. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and segmentation to uncover key customer insights.  

ðŸš€ Tech: **Pandas, Seaborn, XGBoost, Sklearn**

Project Overview:
I built a data-driven **machine learning pipeline** to analyze and predict **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using structured customer data. This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory **data analysis (EDA)**, and predictive modeling to identify key factors influencing CLV.

To enhance data quality, I removed missing values, duplicates, and outliers while transforming categorical variables for analysis. Using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**, I visualized the relationships between age, income, education, marital status, and CLV to uncover insights into customer behavior. Additionally, I engineered new features such as age and income buckets, education indicators, and customer segments to enhance predictive accuracy.

Finally, I trained an **XGBoost** regression model to predict CLV, evaluated its performance using RMSE, and **optimized** it for better accuracy. This project provides valuable **insights** into customer spending patterns and retention strategies, enabling data-driven business decisions.

Project Synopsis:
I developed a** machine learning pipeline** to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model training. The project focuses on identifying key drivers of customer value and leveraging predictive analytics to enhance business insights.

Key steps include:

âœ… Data Cleaning & Outlier Handling â€“ Ensured data integrity and consistency

âœ… EDA & Visualization â€“ Explored customer behavior patterns

âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Created new features for better model accuracy

âœ… Customer Segmentation â€“ Grouped customers based on demographics & spending

âœ… Predictive Modeling â€“ Used XGBoost Regression to forecast CLV

âœ… Model Evaluation â€“ Assessed performance using RMSE

This project helps me understand customer profitability, optimize marketing efforts, and improve retention strategies using machine learning and advanced analytics.
